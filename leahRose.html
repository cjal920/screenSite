              <h3>NEW YORK CITY</h3>
              <h4>SUMMER 1929</h4>
              <p id="lr-syn">
                She has it all. Youth. Beauty. A handsome and successful lawyer
                husband. A lavish Upper East Side penthouse. And all
                the money in the world.
                <br><br>
                And during the last summer of the 1920s, the long hot days Leah Rose spends
                with husband Alfred and their circle of fabulous friends indulging 
                in all the delights the good life has to offer seem to go on without end.
                <br><br>
                But what Leah and no one else around her knows is that these glorious golden days
                are numbered. She doesn't know that just a few miles south of her
                exclusive Upper East Side address, a storm is brewing down on Wall Street. 
                A storm born of reckless speculation that will strike at the heart of the global
                economy in the final days of October. And when it strikes, it leaves her cherished world 
                of privilege and security utterly destroyed.
                <br><br>
                And while Alfred leaves town to try to restore that lost world in a risky   
                bootlegging venture, in the desperate months that follow the most catastrophic 
                financial crisis of all time, Leah will have to fight to make her way in 
                this harrowing new one. 
                <br><br>
                Staying with a trusted but strapped friend from Alfred's youth in a squalid
                house in Greenwich Village he shares with other starving artists, intellectuals 
                and people on the fringes of society, Leah will face new challenges her pampered 
                existence has left her ill-equipped to meet - an unplanned pregnancy; a landlord who 
                wants her out unless she can pay rent; having to find a job to do it; 
                and with each passing day he's gone, the growing fear that Alfred isn't coming back.
                <br><br>
                But as a consequence of her arduous journey and the people she will meet along the way,
                Leah will reconnect with her Jewish heritage, awaken to the plight of the powerless, and 
                gain a far greater sense of purpose than her comfortabe but ultimately hollow old life 
                ever afforded her. Yet even as the spectre of dangerous new political ideologies begin 
                to gain legitimacy in a world growing more and more desperate to relieve the burdens of the 
                global economic depression engulphing it, we can take some comfort that strength and wisdom 
                Leah acquired on her journey of self-discovery will not abandoned her as the world hurtles
                toward the second great war of the century. 
                
                
                
                Leah's journey of self-discovery endows her with the 
                strength and wisdom to meet the demands of these hard times will 
                
                
                
                , there are ominous signs that
                that the dangerous new political philosophies rapidly gaining legitimacy in a world desperate
                to alleviate the global depression may succeed only by bringing about 
                
                
                to solve the 
                global economic depression 
                
                
                the world around her is
                so desperate to alleviate them that it will risk legitimizing dangerous new 
                political philosophies that will end it only by starting a global conflagration that 
                would dwarf the first Great War the 20th century would be fated to endure. 
                
                
                her story is set
                against the backdrop of a world in which dangerous
                political philosophies have 
                
                
                
                
                A journey of self-discovery that endows her with the strength and wisdom
                she needs to meet her considerable obligations in a world so desperate to relieve itself of 
                the economic depression that now appears to be here to stay that it will give legitimacy to

                the 20th century would 


                
                Attributes she will need as the world around her, so desperate to
                
                
                as the dangerous political philosophies gaining traction
                in response to
                
                
                A journey of self-discovery that will take place against the ominous 
                backdrop of a world so desperate to lift the depression
                overwhelming it that it will legitimize dangerous new political philosophies that will 
                bring it to an end only by starting a global conflagration that dwarfs the first Great War 
                the 20th century would 
                
                
                that will
                
                
                rapidly finding legitimacy in the wake of 
                the global economic depression that 
                
                that appears to be here to stay. And will only lift in the 
                whose only remedy will come 

                

                all against 
                as a dangerous political climate unleashed by the global economic turmoil begins to unfold
                as unready world unwittingly creeps toward total war.





                But as a consequence of her struggles and sacrifices, Leah will find the 
                strength to persevere and a far greater sense of purpose than her comfortabe but 
                ultimately unfulfilling old life ever gave her. And like those closest to her, she 
                will weather these hard times in her own way and be changed by them forever.
