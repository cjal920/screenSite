              <h3>NEW YORK CITY</h3>
              <h4>SUMMER 1929</h4>
              <p id="lr-syn">
                She has it all. Youth. Beauty. A handsome and successful lawyer
                husband. A lavish Upper East Side penthouse. And all
                the money in the world.
                <br><br>
                And during the last summer of the 1920s, the long hot days Leah Rose spends
                with husband Alfred and their circle of fabulous friends indulging 
                in all the delights the good life has to offer seem to go on without end.
                <br><br>
                But what Leah and no one else around her knows is that these glorious golden days
                are numbered. She doesn't know that just a few miles south of her
                exclusive Upper East Side address, a storm is brewing down on Wall Street. 
                A storm born of reckless speculation that will strike at the heart of the global
                economy in the final days of October. And when it strikes, it leaves her cherished world 
                of privilege and security utterly destroyed.
                <br><br>
                And while Alfred leaves town to try to restore that lost world in a risky   
                bootlegging venture, in the desperate months that follow the most catastrophic 
                financial crisis of all time, Leah will have to fight to make her way in 
                this harrowing new one. 
                <br><br>
                Staying with a trusted but strapped friend from Alfred's youth in a squalid
                house in Greenwich Village he shares with other starving artists, intellectuals 
                and people on the fringes of society, Leah will face new challenges her pampered 
                existence has left her ill-equipped to meet - an unplanned pregnancy; a landlord who 
                wants her out unless she can pay rent; having to find a job to do it; 
                and with each passing day he's gone, the growing fear that Alfred isn't coming back.
                <br><br>
                But as a consequence of her struggles and sacrifices, Leah will find the 
                strength to persevere and a far greater sense of purpose than her comfortabe but 
                ultimately unfulfilling old life ever gave her. And like those closest to her, she 
                will weather these hard times in her own way and be changed by them forever.
                

                But as a consequence of her arduous journey and the people she meets along the way,
                Leah will reconnect with her Jewish heritage while awakening to the plight of powerless
                
                as a dangerous political climate unleashed by the global economic turmoil begins to unfold
                as unready world unwittingly creeps toward total war.
